# InventoryModel_StrategicDecisionMaking
The project analyzes inventory management, using decision modeling to optimize order quantities that minimize costs. It explores the economic order quantity based on costs and demand, finding an optimal reorder point. A second phase simulates varying demands, guiding strategic inventory adjustments.

The project delves into strategic inventory management for a manufacturing company, aiming to optimize inventory levels to meet demand while minimizing holding costs. Utilizing decision modeling, the study explores economic order quantity (EOQ) to find the ideal order size that balances the cost of ordering and holding inventory. The initial part of the analysis calculates the EOQ based on annual demand, unit cost, holding cost, and ordering cost, aiming to determine the quantity that minimizes overall costs. Through mathematical formulas and Excel Solver, the project identifies the optimal order quantity and the corresponding minimal total inventory cost, establishing a foundation for efficient inventory management.

The second part of the project introduces complexity by considering a triangular probability distribution for annual demand, ranging from 13,000 to 17,000 units with a mode of 15,000 units. Through simulation of 1,000 instances and subsequent analysis, the study seeks to determine the order quantity that leads to the lowest total cost under varying demand conditions. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of how demand variability impacts inventory costs and order quantities. The findings suggest a reorder point and offer insights into how the company can adjust its inventory strategy in response to changes in demand patterns. By addressing both deterministic and probabilistic demand scenarios, the project provides comprehensive guidance for making informed inventory decisions, ultimately recommending strategies for maintaining optimal inventory levels and minimizing costs.
